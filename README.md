# StackMachine
A stackmachine (hobby project)

StackMachine is a hobby project I created to get myself into VMs and interpreters and to stay in touch with the C++ programming language, which I dont use during my normal job as software engineer.

There is no specific goal to this project expect for keeping me busy with C++ and learning new techniques in software development in general.

If you found my repository and you have questions or suggestions about my project or code, feel free to contact me, Id be happy to help or learn from others.
